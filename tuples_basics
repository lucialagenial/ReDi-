# Tuples

# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# You want to introduce immutability.
# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
# the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# Tuples are also similar to lists. It's also an ordered collection of items.
# the only differences of the two is that you CANNOT change the elements on Tuples.
# so if you are sure that your sequence won't change until the end of the program Tuples are what you need.

# To create a tuple you use parenthesis (round brackets) and commas to separate the elements. E.g.:

teachers_tuple = ("Karen", "Nouran", "Diana", "Lorik", "Rita", "Rebecca")
print(teachers_tuple)

# Option 2

students_tuple = tuple(("Anya", "Ayesha", "Eka", "Elle", "Hager", "Lisa", "Lucia", "Mara", "Ola", "Roya", "Sally", "Suelen", "Titi", "Zohreh"))
print(students_tuple)

# Option 3: Tuple packing (creating a tuple without the parenthesis)

my_tuple = 3, 4.5, "dog"
print(my_tuple)

# Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky:

baby_str = ("hello")
print(baby_str)
print(type(baby_str))

baby_tuple = ("hello",)
print(baby_tuple)
print(type(baby_tuple))

baby_tuple2 = "hallo",  # Parenthesis are optional
print(baby_tuple2)
print(type(baby_tuple2))

# Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
# To access elements on a tuple use the index number:

print(teachers_tuple[2])

print(students_tuple[2:7])

# We can also access the elements of a tuple with a for loop:

for teacher in teachers_tuple:
    print("Coding teacher", teacher)

# Length - To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:

print(len(teachers_tuple))
print(len(students_tuple))

# Data Types: Tuple items can be of any data types: string, int, and boolean.
# They can also contain different data types:

tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "female")

# Type : From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with data types 'tuples':

print(type(tuple1))

print(type(my_tuple))

# Deleting a tuple:

#del tuple1 # don't forget to remove the "#" before the sentence. 
#print(tuple1)
